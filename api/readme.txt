- Node.js: https://nodejs.org/
- npm (Node Package Manager), which comes bundled with Node.js

## Installation

```shell
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/api-users.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```shell
cd api-users
```

3. Install project dependencies using npm:

## Running the Application

6. To start the server in development mode using Nodemon, run: `npm run devstart`

API Endpoints:
--------------

### Production Mode

In production mode, the application is run with the following command:

```shell
npm start
```

The server will start, and you can access it at http://localhost:3030/.

### Development Mode

In development mode, you can use `nodemon` to automatically restart the server when you make changes to the code. Run the following command:

```shell
npm run devstart
```

The server will start, and you can access it at http://localhost:3030/. Any changes to the code will trigger an automatic restart.

## API Endpoints

Here are some of the available API endpoints:

- GET all users: http://localhost:3030/users
- GET a specific user by ID: http://localhost:3030/users/:id
- DELETE a user by ID: http://localhost:3030/users/:id
- CREATE a new user: Send a POST request to http://localhost:3030/users with a JSON body.

Refer to the API documentation for more details on using the endpoints.
