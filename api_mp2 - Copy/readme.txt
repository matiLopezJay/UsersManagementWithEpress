**API for Managing Users - README**

This is a simple RESTful API for managing user data, built using Node.js and Express. It provides basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for user resources and uses a JSON file to persist user data.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone this repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the required Node.js dependencies using npm.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the Server with nodemon**

   Start the Express server using nodemon. Nodemon automatically restarts the server when you make changes to your code, making development more efficient.

   ```bash
   nodemon server.js
   ```

   The server should now be running at `http://localhost:3030`.

### Endpoints

The API provides the following endpoints:

- `GET /users`: Retrieve a list of all users.
- `GET /users/:id`: Retrieve a specific user by ID.
- `POST /users`: Create a new user.
- `PUT /users/:id`: Update an existing user by ID.
- `DELETE /users/:id`: Delete an existing user by ID.

### Request Logging

This API uses the `morgan` middleware to log details of incoming requests and responses. You can check the logs in the console when you interact with the API.

### JSON Data Storage

User data is stored in a JSON file (`data/users.json`). When you create, update, or delete users, the data is written to this file to persist the changes.

### Making Requests

You can interact with this API using your preferred API client or tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [curl](https://curl.se/).

### Examples

Here are some examples of how to interact with the API:

1. **Get All Users**

   - Method: `GET`
   - URL: `http://localhost:3030/users`

2. **Get a Specific User**

   - Method: `GET`
   - URL: `http://localhost:3030/users/:id` (replace `:id` with the user's ID)

3. **Create a New User**

   - Method: `POST`
   - URL: `http://localhost:3030/users`
   - Request Body: JSON object representing the user

4. **Update an Existing User**

   - Method: `PUT`
   - URL: `http://localhost:3030/users/:id` (replace `:id` with the user's ID)
   - Request Body: JSON object with updated user data

5. **Delete a User**

   - Method: `DELETE`
   - URL: `http://localhost:3030/users/:id` (replace `:id` with the user's ID)

**RESTful API for Managing Products - README**

This is a simple RESTful API built with Node.js and Express for managing product data. It offers basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for product resources. This API also incorporates request logging and CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) capabilities to enhance functionality.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone this repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   Go to the project directory.

   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the required Node.js dependencies using npm.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the Server with nodemon**

   Start the Express server using nodemon for automatic server reloading during development. Nodemon will restart the server whenever you make changes to your code.

   ```bash
   nodemon server.js
   ```

   The server will be accessible

 at `http://localhost:3030`.

### Endpoints

This API provides the following endpoints:

- `GET /products`: Retrieve a list of all products.
- `GET /products/:id`: Retrieve a specific product by ID.

### Request Logging

Request logging is implemented using the `morgan` middleware. The logs for incoming requests and responses will be displayed in the console.

### JSON Data Storage

Product data is stored in a JSON file, `data/products.json`. When you create, update, or delete products, the changes are written to this file to persist the data.

### Making Requests

You can interact with this API using your preferred API client or tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [curl](https://curl.se/).

### Examples

Here are some examples of how to interact with the API:

   - Method: `GET`
   - URL: `http://localhost:3030/products`

2. **Get a Specific Product**

   - Method: `GET`
   - URL: `http://localhost:3030/products/:id` (replace `:id` with the product's ID)
